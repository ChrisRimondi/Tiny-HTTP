# Implementation Statements for Audit Logging and Monitoring Capabilities

## Control: Identification & Authentication - User & Service Account Inventories (IAC-01.3)
### Implementation Statement:
The organization currently lacks automated mechanisms to maintain a current list of authorized users and service accounts. While the logging capabilities of the service track HTTP requests and responses, there is no explicit implementation of user accounts or service account management. The existing logging only captures operational data, such as HTTP status codes and request handling activities, without providing comprehensive user identification or authentication measures. Consequently, there is no documentation or system in place that ensures the maintenance of an accurate inventory of authorized users and service accounts.

The logging practices in place do support tracking application behavior, which can indirectly aid in identifying unauthorized access attempts. However, the absence of defined authentication and authorization mechanisms in the code means that user access control is not adequately addressed, leaving a significant gap in meeting this control's requirements. Furthermore, the lack of log retention policies and management solutions further complicates the ability to maintain an up-to-date inventory, as it is unclear how long user-related logs would be retained for auditing and compliance purposes.

In summary, while the service demonstrates basic logging capabilities, it does not adequately support the control of maintaining a current list of authorized users and service accounts due to insufficient authentication and authorization implementations.
