# Summary of Encryption and Data Protection Mechanisms

## 1. Encryption Methods
- **Types of Encryption Used**: The service utilizes both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods.
- **Encryption Algorithms and Key Sizes**:
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key size of 256 bits.
  - **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) with key sizes of 2048 bits.
- **Encryption at Rest vs. In Transit**:
  - **At Rest**: Data stored in databases and file systems is encrypted using AES-256.
  - **In Transit**: Data transmitted over networks is protected using TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols.

## 2. Key Management
- **Key Generation and Storage**: Encryption keys are generated securely using a cryptographic random number generator and stored in a secure key vault.
- **Key Rotation Policies**: Keys are rotated every 90 days to minimize the risk of compromise.
- **Key Access Controls**: Access to encryption keys is limited to authorized personnel only, with strict authentication and authorization measures in place.
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM) Usage**: HSMs are employed for key generation, storage, and management to enhance security and compliance.

## 3. Data Protection
- **Data Classification and Handling**: Data is classified based on sensitivity, with specific handling procedures for each classification level.
- **Secure Storage Mechanisms**: Data is stored in encrypted formats, utilizing both file-level and database-level encryption.
- **Data Masking and Anonymization**: Sensitive data is masked or anonymized when used in non-production environments to protect user privacy.
- **Secure Data Transfer Protocols**: Data transfer utilizes secure protocols such as SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

## 4. Security Controls
- **TLS/SSL Configurations**: The service implements TLS 1.2 or higher, with secure cipher suites configured to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Certificate Management**: Digital certificates are managed through an automated system that ensures timely renewal and revocation.
- **Secure Communication Protocols**: Communication between clients and servers is enforced using secure protocols, including HTTPS and secure WebSocket connections.
- **Cryptographic Libraries and Implementations**: The service relies on well-established cryptographic libraries, such as OpenSSL, ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices.
