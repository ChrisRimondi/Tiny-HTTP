There is no evidence of rate limiting, connection limiting, load balancing, or other mechanisms to mitigate the effects of denial-of-service attacks. The service handles TCP connections and HTTP requests asynchronously or via threading but lacks configuration or design elements addressing resource exhaustion or DoS resilience.
