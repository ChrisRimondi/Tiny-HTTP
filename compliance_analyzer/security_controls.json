There are no implemented controls to maintain confidentiality or integrity during pre-transmission preparation or post-reception handling. Sensitive information is neither encrypted nor otherwise protected before transmission, and no mechanisms ensure data integrity upon reception.

There is no evidence of sanitization, type checking, or validation logic in either the asynchronous or threaded HTTP server components.

The service lacks controls such as memory execution protection (e.g., DEP/NX bits), address space layout randomization (ASLR), or sandboxing features.
