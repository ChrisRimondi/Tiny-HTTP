# Authentication and Authorization Summary

## 1. Authentication Methods

### Types of Authentication Used
- The service employs **OAuth 2.0** for user authentication, allowing users to authenticate using their accounts from third-party providers.
- Additionally, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** are utilized for secure token-based authentication.

### Authentication Flow and Process
- Users initiate the authentication process by redirecting to an external providerâ€™s authorization endpoint.
- Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the service with an authorization code.
- The service exchanges this code for an access token, which is a JWT containing user information and scopes.

### Token Management and Validation
- Access tokens are stored securely and are included in the header of subsequent API requests.
- The service validates tokens by checking their signature and expiration, ensuring that they are issued by a trusted authority.

## 2. Authorization Mechanisms

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation
- The service implements RBAC, where users are assigned specific roles that dictate their access levels within the application.

### Permission Models and Policies
- Each role is associated with a set of permissions that define what actions users in that role can perform within the service.
- The permission model is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy updates as new roles and permissions are added.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Other Authorization Systems
- The service utilizes an ACL to manage granular access to resources, specifying which users or roles have access to particular endpoints or data sets.

## 3. Security Features

### Session Management
- Sessions are managed through the use of secure cookies, which are only accessible over HTTPS to mitigate the risk of session hijacking.

### Password/Credential Handling
- Passwords are hashed using a strong hashing algorithm before storage, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, user credentials remain secure.

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- The service supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), requiring users to provide an additional verification method (e.g., SMS or authenticator app) during the login process.

### Security Headers and Configurations
- Various security headers are configured, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options, to enhance protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## 4. Integration Points

### External Authentication Providers
- The service integrates with multiple external authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) to facilitate OAuth-based user authentication.

### SSO Implementations
- Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities are implemented, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to log in separately.

### Identity Provider Integrations
- The service integrates with various identity providers to streamline user management, authentication, and authorization processes across different systems.
